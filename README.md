# City Science Demo React Client

This is super simple client app to interact with the City Science Demo GraphQL API.

## Running

In order to run the application locally, first pull the soruce code, then navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
yarn docker
```

**NOTE:** You need to have `yarn` installed before your run the app (ideally) or you could also use the same command via **NPM**:

```bash
npm run docker
```

## Usage

Once you get the application up and running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/register` and create an account. Once you do that, you'll be signed in and can pick a range of years for which you'd like to receive a traffic data CSV (to download or view).

## Testing

This project is not tested and it's simply provided to ease the testing of the GQL API.
